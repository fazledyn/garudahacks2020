    <h2>Career Mapping</h2>
    <p>Career Mapping is a tool that provides young students on the verge of deciding their career paths with unique,
      data-driven insights to help them build the careers they are suitable for. Career mapping basically depicts the
      clear picture of what the student has done till now, academically & socially. To prepare Career Map, we ask in for
      all the academic mark-sheets of the students, along with any extra and co-curricular certificates. We also ask
      them to provide information on any educational tours and visits made.

      Also they have to fill in a questionnaire which depicts the parents socio-economic status, their educational and
      occupational background and medical history.

      Based on all this information we prepare a career graph which shows the ups and downs in the student’s career.

      Also from extra and co-curricular activities we try to find their inclination towards any particular
      field/activity. Or in other words you can say, their inner capabilities and interest area for a particular field
      or work. So that proper guidance can be given in terms of choosing the right career path.

      In short like a GPS in your car, Career Maps display alternative routes to build mastery in the core professions.
      Mastery is being the “best you can be” and those who achieve mastery of their professions or trades are leaders,
      mentors and innovators.</p>

        <center><u><b>What is Education?</b></u>
      </h1>
      </center>
      <p>The first thing that strikes in our minds when we think about education is gaining knowledge. Education is a
        tool which provides people with knowledge, skill, technique, information, enables them to know their rights and
        duties toward their family, society as well as the nation. It expands vision and outlook to see the world. It
        develops the capabilities to fight against injustice, violence, corruption and many other bad elements in the
        society.</p>

      <p>Education gives us knowledge of the world around us. It develops in us a perspective of looking at life. It is
        the most important element in the evolution of the nation. Without education, one will not explore new ideas. It
        means one will not able to develop the world because without ideas there is no creativity and without
        creativity, there is no development of the nation.</p>

      <center><i><b>
            <h2>Importance of Education in Our Society</h2>
          </b></i></center>
      Education is an important aspect that plays a huge role in the modern, industrialized world. People need a good
      education to be able to survive in this competitive world. Modern society is based on people who have high living
      standards and knowledge which allows them to implement better solutions to their problems.

      <center><i><b>
            <h2>Features of Education</h2>
          </b></i></center>

      <center><i><b>
            <h3>Education empowers everyone. Some of the areas where education helps are:</h3>
          </b></i></center>
      <h4><i>1. Removing Poverty</i></h4>
      <p>Education helps in removing poverty as if a person is educated, he can get a good job and fulfill all the basic
        needs & requirement of his family.</p>

      <h4><i>2. Safety and Security against Crime</i></h4>
      <p>If a person is well-educated, he will not be fooled by anyone easily. An educated person is less prone to
        involve in domestic violence & other social evils. They enjoy healthy relationships in life. This means people
        are less susceptible to being cheated or becoming a victim of violence.</p>

      <h4><i>3. Prevention of Wars and Terrorism</i></h4>
      <p>To lead a safe & secure life, one needs to understand the value of education in our daily life. One needs to
        take an active part in various educational activities. These types of productive activities provide knowledge to
        live a better life.</p>

      <h4><i>4. Commerce and Trade</i></h4>
      <p>A good education doesn’t simply mean going to school or college & getting a degree. Trade & commerce of the
        country will also be flourished easily if its citizens are well-educated. Education helps to become
        self-dependent and build great confidence among them to accomplish difficult tasks. On getting an education,
        their standard of life gets improved.</p>

      <h4><i>5. Law and Order</i></h4>
      <p>Education enables the process of the Nation’s Fast Development. If you have a good education, you can serve
        your country well. It develops a good political ideology.</p>

      <h4><i>6. Women Empowerment</i></h4>
      <p>Education also helps in empowering women. Certain old customs like Not Remarrying Widows, Sati Pratha, Child
        Marriage, Dowry System etc. can be demolished with the power of education. Women, if educated, can raise voice
        against the injustice done to her. This will bring a lot of development in society as well as in the nation. In
        short, Right to Freedom of speech & expression can be used in the right way if all women will become educated.
      </p>

      <h4><i>7. Upliftment of economically weaker sections of society</i></h4>
      <p>Education is the most important ingredient to change the world. Due to lack of education, many illiterate
        people suffer the hardships of discrimination, untouchability & injustices prevailing in the society but with
        the advancement of a good education. If all the people will be educated; this ultimately leads to the upliftment
        of economically weaker sections of society.</p>

      <h4><i>8. Communications</i></h4>
      <p>The relation between education & communication is apparent. Good education helps to communicate better with
        other people. It also improves our communication skills such as speech, body language etc. A person who is
        educated feels confident within him to confront or give a speech in front of a large public or can held a
        meeting or seminar.

        Writing emails, letters, typing messages, reading magazines & newspapers or even using a Smartphone can never be
        possible without getting a basic education.</p>

      <h2><i><b>Role of Education in Society</b></i></h2>
      <p>Education is the social institution through which society provides its members with important knowledge,
        including basic facts, job skills, and cultural norms values.</p>

      <p>One of the most important benefits of education is that it improves personal lives and helps the society to run
        smoothly. By providing education, poverty can be removed and every person can provide their contribution to
        developing the country.</p>

      <h2><i><b>Education Helps in Creation of a better society.</b></i></h2>
      <p>An educated person is more likely to develop better moral and ethical values as compared to an uneducated
        person. Lack of education creates problems like superstition, domestic violence, poor health, and poor living
        standards. Education brings equal opportunity for both men and women and educated people will be able to create
        a better society. Without a good education, a better society can’t be formed.</p>

      <p>Education act as Back Bone of a Society.
        Education is an integral part of human society. Its importance in life can’t be ignored as lack of education
        gives birth to numerous social problems like poor health, internal conflict, poor living standards and many
        more. It helps people to find a better solution to their problems. Education lets people realize the true value
        of contribution and help become the backbone of the society.</p>

      <h3><i><b>Education encourages Innovation and Creativity.</b></i></h3>
      <p>Education means innovation. Innovation and creativity can only occur when people are skilled enough to know how
        to operate with different technologies. Educated people always find a solution to their problems with the help
        of better techniques.</p>

      <p>Education Can Create Better Human Beings.
        Education is the most powerful weapon which we can use to change the perspective of the world. An educated
        person knows how to deal with different types of problems. Through the right education, a person can develop
        good moral values. It helps us to become a good human being.</p>

      <p>Education Gives Ability to Read & Write.
        <i><b>“A man without education is like a building without foundation.”</b></i></p>

      <p>Education helps a person to be able to read and write. Most of the information is communicated by writing. A
        man who has this ability to read is called a literate.</p>

      <p>He can read books, newspapers, signs, and symbols. It also helps to read signboards in the street, at shops,
        bus, train and air stations. It also helps them in their day to day activities like banking, shopping, money
        transaction and many more.</p>

      <p>Without primary education, one has to depend on others for all the above basic needs.
        <p>

          <h2><i><b>Understanding the Responsibilities</b></i></h2>
          <p>As a social being, it is our responsibility to give something back to the society and make it a better
            place
            for the next generation. An uneducated man can’t be fully aware of his responsibilities. An educated person
            is
            aware of his personal as well as social responsibilities. Proper education teaches a person to think beyond
            his
            personal interests and also provides him the ability to give something back to the society.</p>

          <p><b>Without educated people<b>, this world can’t become a better place. That is why proper education is
                needed
                to turn this world into a better place. Hence, we can conclude that for the evolution of a country,
                there is
                a need for education.</p>

      <p>Holland's theories of vocational choice, The Holland Occupational Themes, "now pervades career counseling
        research and practice".[2] Its origins "can be traced to an article in the Journal of Applied Psychology in 1958
        and a subsequent article in 1959 that set out his theory of vocational choices. ... The basic premise was that
        one's occupational preferences were in a sense a veiled expression of underlying character."[6] The 1959 article
        in particular ("A Theory of Vocational Choice," published in the Journal of Counseling Psychology) is considered
        the first major introduction of Holland's "theory of vocational personalities and work environments".</p>
